1. General Information
==================================================

Mirth Connect is an open source health care integration engine. By supporting numerous standards (like HL7, EDI, XML, NCPDP, DICOM, and Delimited Text) and protocols (like LLP, JDBC, and FTP), Mirth Connect allows for the filtering, transformation, and routing of messages between disparate systems to allow them to share data.


2. Installation and Upgrade
==================================================

A Mirth Connect installer is available as an executable file. Pre-packaged distributions are also available for individual operating systems (EXE for Windows, SH for Unix/Linux, and APP for Mac OS X). The installer allows you to automatically upgrade previously Mirth Connect installations (starting with version 1.5).

The Windows installer also comes with the option to install and start a service which will run the background. If you choose to install the service, you also have the option of installing and running the Mirth Connect Server Manager which allows you to start and stop the service, as well as view the system logs and change the Mirth Connect backend database settings.

An optional Mirth Connect Shell can be installed which allows you to connect to a running Mirth Connect server through a command line interface. This tool is useful for recovery of a Mirth Connect installation.
After the installation, the Mirth Connect directory and file layout will look as follows:

/client-lib: Libraries for the Mirth Connect Administrator
/manager-lib: Libraries for the Mirth Connect Server Manager (if installed)
/custom-lib: Place your custom user libraries here
/conf: Configuration files and backend database access scripts
/docs: This document and a copy of the Mirth Connect license 
/extensions: Libraries and meta data for Plug-ins and Connectors
/lib: Mirth Connect server libraries
/logs: Default location for debug logs generated by Mirth Connect and its sub-components
/mirthdb: The embedded database (Do NOT delete if you specify Derby as your database)
/public_html: Directory exposed by the embedded web server


3. Starting Mirth Connect
==================================================

Once Mirth Connect has been installed, there are several ways to connect to launch the Mirth Connect Administrator. On a Windows installation, there is a Mirth Connect Administrator item in the Start Menu which launches the application directly.

If the option is not available, you can connect to the Mirth Connect Administrator launch page which by default should be available at http://[server address]:8080. Clicking the Launch Mirth Connect Administrator button will connect you to the server which will be listening on https://[server address]:8443. If running a new installation, the default username and password for the login screen is admin and admin. This should be changed immediately for security purposes.

If you are launching the administrator for the first time, you will notice that the libraries for the Mirth Connect Administrator will be loaded. This feature allows you run the Administrator from any remote Mirth Connect server without having to download and install a separate client.

You may also notice a security warning when starting the administrator (dialog box depends on browser being used). This is normal and you should click Run to continue launching the administrator.
