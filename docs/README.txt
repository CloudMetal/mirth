1. General Information
==================================================
Mirth is an open source health care integration engine. By supporting numerous standards (like HL7, EDI, XML, and NCPDP) and protocols (like LLP, JDBC, and FTP), Mirth allows for the filtering, transformation, and routing of messages between disparate systems to allow them to share data.

2. Installation and Upgrade
==================================================
A Mirth installer is available as an executable JAR file. Pre-packaged distributions are also available for individual operating systems (EXE for Windows, SH for Unix/Linux, and APP for Mac OS X). The installer allows you to automatically upgrade previously Mirth installations (starting with version 1.5).
The Windows installer also comes with the option to install and start a service which will run the background. If you choose to install the service, you also have the option of installing and running the Mirth Server Manager which allows you to start and stop the service, as well as view the system logs and change the Mirth backend database settings.
An optional Mirth Shell can be installed which allows you to connect to a running Mirth server through a command line interface. This tool is useful for recovery of a Mirth installation.
After the installation, the Mirth directory and file layout will look as follows:

/client-lib: Libraries for the Mirth Administrator
/conf: Configuration files and backend database access scripts
/extensions: Libraries and meta data for Plug-ins and Connectors
/lib: Mirth server libraries
/licenses: Licenses for various open source components used in Mirth
/logs: Debug logs generated by Mirth and its sub-components
/mirthdb: The embedded database (Do NOT delete)
/public_html: Directory exposed by the embedded web server
/Uninstaller: Contains the uninstaller
Mirth.bat, Mirth.exe, mirth.sh: Starts the Mirth server
Shell.bat, shell.sh: Starts the Mirth command console
 
3. Starting Mirth
==================================================
Once Mirth has been installed, there are several ways to connect to launch the Mirth Administrator. On a Windows installation, there is a Mirth Administrator item in the Start Menu which launches the application directly.
If the option is not available, you can connect to the Mirth Administrator launch page which by default should be available at http://[server address]:8080. Clicking the Launch Mirth Administrator button will connect you to the server which will be listening on https://[server address]:8443. If running a new installation, the default username and password for the login screen is admin and admin. This should be changed immediately for security purposes.
If you are launching the administrator for the first time, you will notice that the libraries for the Mirth Administrator will be loaded. This feature allows you run the Administrator from any remote Mirth server without having to download and install a separate client.
You may also notice a security warning when starting the administrator (dialog box depends on browser being used). This is normal and you should click Run to continue launching the administrator.
