					First, make sure that you are using an up to date version of Java.  Mirth requires at least Java 5.0 to compile and run.  Second, make sure that you have included all of the libraries that are required to compile Mirth.  Otherwise,
					if you are certain that this is a bug in the source code, please forward the concern to mirth@mirthcorp.com.<br><br>

		<span class="innerHeading">How do I setup Java?</span>
			<table cellpadding=10>
				<tr><td>
					The way that you setup Java depends on what operating system you are currently using.<br><br>

					Please refer to <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/install.html">this</a> page to view installation instructions based upon your operating system.<br><br>
				</td></tr>
			</table>
		<span class="innerHeading">I don't really understand what is needed to run Mirth, could you please clarify?</span>
			<table cellpadding=10>
				<tr><td>
					There are two parts to Mirth: a graphical administrative application and the underlying server application.  The administrative application
					connects to the server application which contains all of the data and deals with actually processing the users commands.  One server can
					potentially be accessed by many users at the same time.  Both of these parts of Mirth are required to use its functionality.<br><br>
